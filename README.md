# Clothes-InPainting

Importing Libraries: The code imports various libraries, including PyTorch, torchvision, PIL, cv2, base64, and matplotlib. These libraries are used for image processing, visualization, and inpainting.

Importing Models: The code imports the CLIP and ClipSeg models for image classification and segmentation tasks. It also imports the Stable Diffusion Inpainting model for inpainting the masked regions of the image.

Preparing the Source Image: The code reads an image from the file and resizes it to the target width and height. It also applies normalization and converts it to a tensor.

Creating Masks: The code uses ClipSeg to identify elements in the picture and create masks for the specified prompts (e.g., 'a hat,' 'a dark skirt,' etc.). It processes the masks to normalize the values.

Inpainting: The code performs inpainting using the Stable Diffusion model. It generates multiple inpainting results with different prompts ('a skirt full of text,' 'blue flowers,' etc.) and masks and stores them in a list.

Displaying the Results: The code contains a function create_image_plus_masks_grid to display the original image along with the inpainting results using masks. It visualizes the inpainting results with the names of the corresponding prompts.

Overall, this code takes an input image, identifies specific elements using ClipSeg, applies inpainting with Stable Diffusion based on user-specified prompts, and displays the original image and inpainting results using masks and prompts. The result is a grid showing the original image along with multiple inpainted versions, each with a different prompt.
